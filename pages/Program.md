##29 July, Monday

###16:30 - 18:00 MSS advanced course / IK Workshop  #1
Introduction to REACH co-creative software.

This course will present a set of tools that enable interactive improvisation between the human and the machine. Tools such as Omax, Somax2, Djazz, Dicy2 allow Max to improvise in collaboration with humans by capturing human performances, navigating through music corpuses and latent spaces of musical features, and adapting continuously to the evolving musical context using generative model and audio / midi rendering.

###18:00 - 19:30 Improtech lecture session #1
**Miller Puckette** (Ircam), Advanced improvised interaction systems

**Marc Chemillier** (EHESS) & al, Keeping the swing, AI cocreative musicianship in collective idiomatic settings

<br><br>

##30 July, Tuesday 

###16:30 - 18:00 MSS advanced course / IK Workshop #2
Introduction to Somax2

This course will focus on the cocreative AI improvisation environment Somax2, detailing its basic concepts, the applicative user interface, the main controls, interaction strategies and musical scenarios, with concrete musical examples and demos..

###18:00 - 19:30 Improtech lecture session #2
**Shlomo Dubnov** (UCSD, Qualcomm Institute), Advanced Machine Learning and Music Information dynamics for Deep and Shallow CoCreative Systems

**Nicolas Brochec**, **Marco Fiorini** (Geidai, Ircam) : Real-Time Recognition of Instrument Playing Techniques for Mixed Music and CoCreative Interaction

<br><br>

##31 July, Wednesday 

###16:30 - 18:00 MSS advanced course / IK Workshop #3
Somax2 advanced course

This course will dive into the advanced use of Somax2, including mastering of expert controls in the UI, accessing and programming the Max Library interface, scripting for real life performances, and taking advantage of multi-agent network connectivity.
