##29 July, Monday

###16:30 - 18:00 MSS advanced course / IK Workshop  #1
Introduction to REACH co-creative software.

This course will present a set of tools that enable interactive improvisation between the human and the machine. Tools such as Omax, Somax2, Djazz, Dicy2 allow Max to improvise in collaboration with humans by capturing human performances, navigating through music corpuses and latent spaces of musical features, and adapting continuously to the evolving musical context using generative model and audio / midi rendering.

###18:00 - 19:30 Improtech lecture session #1
**Miller Puckette** (Ircam), Advanced improvised interaction systems

**Marc Chemillier** (EHESS) & al, Keeping the swing, AI cocreative musicianship in collective idiomatic settings

<br><br>

##30 July, Tuesday 

###16:30 - 18:00 MSS advanced course / IK Workshop #2
Introduction to Somax2

This course will focus on the cocreative AI improvisation environment Somax2, detailing its basic concepts, the applicative user interface, the main controls, interaction strategies and musical scenarios, with concrete musical examples and demos..

###18:00 - 19:30 Improtech lecture session #2
