#### Evan Parker, Matt Wright, Peter Evans, Mark Nauseef
Quartet

Evan Parker : saxophones
Matt Wright: electronics
Peter Evans: trumpet
Mark Nauseef: percussion

Evan Parker, saxophonist and one of the founding fathers of the European improvised music scene since the late 1960s has chosen to assemble a version of Trance Map+, the group he co leads with Matt Wright, which adds percussionist Mark Nauseef and trumpetist Peter Evans to make a new quartet.  Both Mark and Peter have played in other larger combinations but this will be a debut for this specific combination. For the occasion they will be composing site specific new music by improvisation


####Georg Hajdu  
Just Her - Jester - Gesture

Lin Chen : kalimba<br>
Georg Hajdu : computer & live electronics

Just Her – Jester – Gesture is a composition in Bohlen-Pierce tuning for augmented kalimba and electronics written in 2010. It was premiered on occasion of my 50th birthday on June 21, 2010 at the EMS conference hosted by the Shanghai Conservatory’s Electro-Acoustic Music Center (EAMC). 

The piece is in three parts:

* Just Her – a (fully notated) kalimba solo without electronics
* Jester   – a (fully notated) duet between kalimba and computer running the real-time algorithmic composition/improvisation software DJster
* Gesture – an improvisatory part in which the kalimba player uses gestures freely to control the computer, alternating with short interspersed solo passages.

Just Her – Jester – Gesture requires a Hugh-Tracey alto kalimba. This instrument ordinarily covers the diatonic range from g3 to g5 (c4 being middle C). By nudging each of the 15 tines, the tuning can be adjusted to the Bohlen-Pierce scale. Kalimbas are characterized by an alternating “centrifugal” layout of the tines, which allows a scale to be played by both hands in an outward alternating motion. I designed a suitable type of notation to capture the logic of this layout and used MaxScore to implement it. MaxScore is a notation program, developed by Nick Didkovsky and myself, capable of both displaying and playing back music in non-standard tuning. 

A wireless controller attached to the back of kalimba with a strip of velcro drives a real-time generative computer process accompanying the performance of the kalimba player. The engine I used is a Max patch called DJster and is based on Clarence Barlow’s legacy program AUTOBUSK. DJster generates notes, which are routed to a playback device using resonance models for synthesis. The ResAn program (part of IRCAM’s Diphone package) was used to analyze the resonances of a regular kalimba tone, a knock on its body as well as the sounds of wiping across the tines and the body

Just Her – Jester – Gesture will be performed by Hamburg-based percussionist Lin Chen.
