#### Evan Parker, Matt Wright, Peter Evans, Mark Nauseef
*Trance Map+*  

Evan Parker : saxophones  
Matt Wright: electronics  
Peter Evans: trumpet  
Mark Nauseef: percussion  

Evan Parker, saxophonist and one of the founding fathers of the European improvised music scene since the late 1960s has chosen to assemble a version of Trance Map+, the group he co leads with Matt Wright, which adds percussionist Mark Nauseef and trumpetist Peter Evans to make a new quartet.  Both Mark and Peter have played in other larger combinations but this will be a debut for this specific combination. For the occasion they will be composing site specific new music by improvisation.
Evan Parker and Matt Wright met in 2008 and out of their first studio sessions developed Trance Map, an album of over an hour that mixes field recordings, samples from cassettes, turntable scratching and the live processing of Evan's relentlessly evolving saxophone lines. Since that time the project has developed to include live events across Europe, often involving (Trance Map+) guest performers such as Toma Gouband, Peter Evans, Hannah Marshall and Barry Guy. A US version of the group (featuring Evan Parker, Matt Wright, Mark Nauseef, Adam Linson and Ned Rothenberg) performed at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville in late March 2019. Trance Map+ Live in Nikkelsdorf (featuring Evan Parker, Matt Wright, Spring Heel Jack and Adam Linson) will be released on Intakt in summer/autumn 2019.

*In good company*  
for 2 pianists, guest musicians and webaudio devices

Conceived as a small musical theatre of “interactions”, In good company is a cycle of small pieces. The cycle is organised as an organic living form that progressively expands. It’s built from minimal individual interaction (fingers - piano keys) towards more complex collective interaction between performers and various objects. Its multilayered structure includes visual, sound, gestural and environmental elements. The score is actually a proposition for games that pushes the performers to try new things, take risks and surprise themselves. In addition to instrumental sounds, they also manipulate cell phones, hacking these objects that intermediates in our everyday life much of the interaction with the others. Here, our main interest is to continuously operate shifts in changing rules, eventually creating a large form.
This piece was designed with the support of the VERTIGO project as part of the STARTS program of the European Commission, based on technological elements from BeCoMe.

####Georg Hajdu  
*Just Her - Jester - Gesture*  
for augmented kalimba and live electronics

Georg Hajdu : composer, computer & live electronics  
Lin Chen : kalimba  

Just Her – Jester – Gesture is a composition in Bohlen-Pierce tuning for augmented kalimba and electronics written in 2010. It was premiered on occasion of my 50th birthday on June 21, 2010 at the EMS conference hosted by the Shanghai Conservatory’s Electro-Acoustic Music Center (EAMC). 

The piece is in three parts:

* Just Her – a (fully notated) kalimba solo without electronics
* Jester   – a (fully notated) duet between kalimba and computer running the real-time algorithmic composition/improvisation software DJster
* Gesture – an improvisatory part in which the kalimba player uses gestures freely to control the computer, alternating with short interspersed solo passages.

Just Her – Jester – Gesture requires a Hugh-Tracey alto kalimba. This instrument ordinarily covers the diatonic range from g3 to g5 (c4 being middle C). By nudging each of the 15 tines, the tuning can be adjusted to the Bohlen-Pierce scale. Kalimbas are characterized by an alternating “centrifugal” layout of the tines, which allows a scale to be played by both hands in an outward alternating motion. I designed a suitable type of notation to capture the logic of this layout and used MaxScore to implement it. MaxScore is a notation program, developed by Nick Didkovsky and myself, capable of both displaying and playing back music in non-standard tuning. 

A wireless controller attached to the back of kalimba with a strip of velcro drives a real-time generative computer process accompanying the performance of the kalimba player. The engine I used is a Max patch called DJster and is based on Clarence Barlow’s legacy program AUTOBUSK. DJster generates notes, which are routed to a playback device using resonance models for synthesis. The ResAn program (part of IRCAM’s Diphone package) was used to analyze the resonances of a regular kalimba tone, a knock on its body as well as the sounds of wiping across the tines and the body

Just Her – Jester – Gesture will be performed by Hamburg-based percussionist Lin Chen.
