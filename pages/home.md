Summary: Improtech Marseille gathers scholars, technologists, musicians, makers, around the idea of musical improvisation with digital intelligence

#### Workshop - Festival, October 22 - 24, 2022 at Palais Carli, Marseille Conservatory
<br>
<br>
**Improtech** is both a **musical festival** and an **interdisciplinary workshop** bringing together actors of research and creation from all over the world, around the question of **musical improvisation** in interaction with **digital intelligences**, in an assumed approach of human-machine **co-creativity**.

**Improtech @ Marseille !** (ikMA'22) will be held from October 22 to 24, 2022 at the Palais Carli, in the beautiful spaces of the Conservatoire National Pierre Barbizet, along with **satellite events** in the city during the week of October 17.

Scholars, musicians, artists, students, will lecture, give workshops, teach master classes, and perform in concerts. **ikMA'19** will flourish on the explosive encounter of **cutting edge researchers**, **great musicians** from the jazz, contemporary or traditional scene, and the **young avant-garde** scene of Marseille.

**ikMA'22** combines a great diversity of aesthetics while covering many knowledge fields, from computer scie nce to anthropology, from musicology to critical studies, from philosophy to artificial intelligence, from acoustics to mixed realities...

ikMA'22 comes after the  much praised [Paris - Athina edition](http://ikparisathina.ircam.fr), the [Paris - Philadelphia edition](http://ikparisphilly.ircam.fr), and the [Paris - New-york edition](http://repmus.ircam.fr/improtechpny).
