#### This is the general Improtech Home Page

## A New alliance
Improtech is dedicated to the explosive alliance between the age-old art of improvisation and the emerging cultures of digital intelligence. It fosters the co-creative dynamics that can exist between humans and machines, and in so doing, creates new meeting grounds between people, artists and audiences of all backgrounds and levels.

Exploring the relationships between music and science, composition and improvisation, writing and performance, music and other performance arts in "cyber-human" settings, Improtech has established itself as one of the major events of contemporary research and creation.

## A Workshop - Festival
**Improtech** is both a **musical festival** and an **interdisciplinary workshop** bringing together actors of research and creation from all over the world fostering **musical improvisation** in interaction with **digital intelligences**, in an assumed approach of human-machine **co-creativity**.
