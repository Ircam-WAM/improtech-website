**Improtech** is both a musical festival and an interdisciplinary workshop that brings together actors and actresses of research and creation from all over the world around the question of musical improvisation in interaction with digital intelligences, in an assumed approach of human-machine co-creativity.

**Improtech @ Marseille !** (ikMA'22) will be held from October 22 to 24, 2022 at the Palais Carli, in the beautiful spaces of the Conservatoire National Pierre Barbizet, with satellite events in the city during the week of October 17.

Scholars, students, musicians, will come from many places in world to talk about their work, demo, teach and perform. **ikPA'19** will flourish on the explosive encounter of prominent research labs and scholars, well established musical figures of Jazz, contemporary music, traditional music from the mediterranean area, and the  avant-garde scene of Marseille .

**ikMA'22** will combine, around the central theme of improvisation, a great diversity of aesthetic approaches while convening artists and experts covering many knowledge fields, including computer music, artificial intelligence, robotics, musicology / ethno-musicology, philosophy / anthropology, critical studies, acoustics and signal processing.

ikMA'22 comes after the  much praised [Paris - Athina edition](http://ikparisathina.ircam.fr), the [Paris - Philadelphia edition](http://ikparisphilly.ircam.fr), and the [Paris - New-york edition](http://repmus.ircam.fr/improtechpny).
