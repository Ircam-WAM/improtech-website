##Improtech
gathers scholars, researchers, musicians, makers, around the idea of **musical improvisation in interaction with digital intelligence**, taking note of the important development of this new creative field.
ikPA'19 creates a link between the european and worlwide research and creation scenes through the symbolic matching of  Paris, where the event [originated at Ircam](http://recherche.ircam.fr/equipes/repmus/SMC04/), and an other emblematic city. **This year Paris will connect with Athens**, in a powerful arc between science and the art of improvisation, after the  [Paris - Philadelphia edition](http://ikparisphilly.ircam.fr) last year, and the [Paris - New-york edition](http://repmus.ircam.fr/improtechpny) a few years ago.

It is thus a unique opportunity for intercultural and interdisciplinary encounters among international research and creation communities.

ImproTech is being held in 2019 with the support of [Onassis STEGI](https://www.onassis.org/onassis-stegi) and the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/) (UOA), in addition to the workshop's founding organisms, to allow the public to observe the aesthetic, technological and sociological developments that have taken place since previous editions.
This meeting point in the heart of the  Hellenic capital is a stimulating destination because of the city's young and lively improvisation scene, the many men and women who promote research in music science and technology in the Greek universities, and of course the central position of Greek culture in the history of improvised music, from its practice to its theory.

Scholars, students, musicians, will come from many places in world to talk about their work, demo, teach and perform. **ikPA'19** will flourish on the explosive encounter of prominent research labs and scholars, well established musical figures of Jazz, contemporary music, traditional music from the mediterranean area, and the  avant-garde scene of Greece .

**ikPA'19** will combine, around the central theme of improvisation, a great diversity of aesthetic approaches while convening artists and experts covering many knowledge fields, including computer music, artificial intelligence, robotics, musicology / ethno-musicology, philosophy / anthropology, critical studies, acoustics and signal processing.

###Participants

**Evan Parker**, saxophonist is one of the **founding fathers of the European improvised music scene since the late 1960s**. Evan Parker transformed the language and techniques of the instrument in the late 1960s and has since become one of the most admired and influential saxophone improvisers on the planet. Parker has been rewriting the book on the sounds that can be made with a saxophone for almost half a century, developing a remarkable post-Coltrane technique that has allowed him to play counterpoint on what was designed as a single-line instrument, generate electronics-like textures acoustically, and build a personal soundscape that avoids conventional tunes but has its own arresting lyricism. Parker has worked with comparable revolutionaries like John Zorn and Anthony Braxton and singer-songwriter Robert Wyatt. **Parker is widely acknowledged as "one of the music's greatest living instrumentalists"** (The Times), "one of the world's finest ensemble improvisers" (Chicago Reader) and "one of the modern era's most original voices" (The Wire).  
Evan Parker will perform with Trance Map+, his duo Trance Map with composer **Matt Wright** (live electronics) augmented with new guests (**Peter Evans** and **Mark Nauseef** on trumpet and percussionsq). “**[Trance Map richly repays repeated listening and intense concentration being invested in it […] it is mesmerizingly beautiful**.” (All About Jazz) “Evan Parker and Matthew Wright’s intriguing collaboration edits layers of live performance into a shimmering mist of undulating and unbroken sonic textures [...] the result enthrals and soothes in equal measure.” (The Financial Times)
