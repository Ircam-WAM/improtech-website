**Improtech** is both a **musical festival** and an **interdisciplinary workshop** bringing together actors of research and creation from all over the world fostering **musical improvisation** in interaction with **digital intelligences**, in an assumed approach of human-machine **co-creativity**.

After praised editions in New York, Philadelphia, Athens, Uzeste and Tokyo **Improtech Paris** (ikParis'25) will land down in Paris, at [Ircam,](https://www.ircam.fr) where the concept was created, for the first time !

Organized as part of the European [REACH project](reach.ircam.fr), the Improtech international workshop-festival is dedicated to combining the universal art of improvisation with digital intelligence cultures through a series of conferences, interdisciplinary workshops, installations, performances, and concerts. After traveling across three continents and bringing together leading figures in the field, **Improtech returns to Ircam**, one of its founders, for an edition that will focus on space and composition/improvidsation and pay tribute to American composer George Lewis, an essential reference in musical AI. 

This year, Ircam will host Improtech  concerts in its unique concert hall, Espace de projection, encouraging **a triple synthesis**:  that of acoustic instrumental culture with the original interactive artificial intelligence developed by the REACH project, that of solo improvisation with writing for mixed ensembles, and finally that of spatialization and sound immersion, also renewed by creative AI. This groundbreaking combination, supported by leading artistic figures in **composition, improvisation, performance, and technology**, will undoubtedly create a dazzling version of this sixth Improtech.

George presents a piece performed by **Joelle Leandre** and **Miya Masaoka** on the Koto, with the SoVo system resulting from common research with [REACH](reach.ircam.fr),.


The **Who/Men** from Ircam (Marco Fiorini, Mikhail Malt, Gérard Assayag, Manuel Poletti) along with **Marc Chemillier** and **Sylvain Cadars** will create a sonic space thanks to the cocreative AI tools from the [REACH](https://reach.ircam.fr) project.


Workshops and lectures will cover a vast panorama of advanced machine learning and machine listening, gestural and spatial control, software environments, Creative Artificial Intelligence, including inevitable esthetical and epistemological questions.

## A New alliance
<br>

Improtech is dedicated to the explosive alliance between the age-old art of improvisation and the emerging cultures of digital intelligence. It fosters the co-creative dynamics that can exist between humans and machines, and in so doing, creates new meeting grounds between people, artists and audiences of all backgrounds and levels.

Exploring the relationships between music and science, composition and improvisation, writing and performance, music and other performance arts in "cyber-human" settings, Improtech has established itself as one of the major events of contemporary research and creation.
