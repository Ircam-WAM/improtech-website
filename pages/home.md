In addition to the regular programme, a truly exceptional event will enlight this year's Improtech with a a performance at **[Konnoh Hachimangu Shrine](https://www.konno-hachimangu.jp/history.html)** in Shibuya, a one thousand year old cultural milestone linked to the Shibuya clan and Japan's tumultuous  medieval history, also known as one  of Tokyo's rarest early Edo architectural jewels. The shrine is also associated with the life of the great writer Yukio **Mishima **who was a regular here. This crazy adventure was made possible thanks to **Joni Waka** (Johnny Walker), a character in **Murakami**’s novel Kafka on the shore who happens to be very real and part of Tokyo’s living legends.


Composer **Georges Bloch** will perform in the shrine with the Butoh dancer **Taketeru Kudo** who renews the Butoh genre and opens it to contemporary music, along with the bass player **Takashi Seo** who unleashed all the power of free impro on his instrument.

## A New alliance
<br>

Improtech is dedicated to the explosive alliance between the age-old art of improvisation and the emerging cultures of digital intelligence. It fosters the co-creative dynamics that can exist between humans and machines, and in so doing, creates new meeting grounds between people, artists and audiences of all backgrounds and levels.

Exploring the relationships between music and science, composition and improvisation, writing and performance, music and other performance arts in "cyber-human" settings, Improtech has established itself as one of the major events of contemporary research and creation.
