####Jérôme Nika
is a postdoctoral researcher in the Music Representations team at Ircam (UMR STMS 9912 CNRS). He graduated from the “Grandes Écoles” Télécom ParisTech and ENSTA ParisTech. In addition, he studied acoustics, signal processing and computer science applied to music (multidisciplinary Master’s degree ATIAM in sciences and technologies for music, UPMC Paris 6, Télécom ParisTech, Ircam). His PhD work “Guiding human-computer music improvisation“ (“Young Researcher Prize in Science and Music" in 2015; “Young Researcher Prize" awarded by the French Association of Computer Music in 2016) focused on the introduction of authoring, composition, and control in human-computer music co-improvisation. Through the development of the software ImproteK and within the DYCI2 project, his research focuses on the integration of scenarios in music generation processes, and on the dialectic between reactivity and planning in interactive human-computer music improvisation.

####Danae Stefanou
Danae Stefanou makes improvised sounds and texts. She is Associate
Professor at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki where she teaches a
variety of courses on experimental music, critical studies and contemporary
music historiography, and directs the AUTH Experimental and Improvised
Music Ensembles. She has previously worked as Visiting Lecturer / Research
Associate at Royal Holloway, University of London, and as Project Manager
for the Chopin’s First Editions Online and Online Chopin Variorum Edition
projects (2003-2007). In her own research, she examines experimental &
improvised music histories and aesthetics from a variety of ethnographic,
archival and analytical perspectives, and has published widely in
peer-reviewed journals (*JRMA*, *JIMS*, *Musicae Scientiae*) and edited
volumes, including *Contemporary Popular Music Studies *(Springer, 2019),
*Made in Greece: Studies in Greek Popular Music *(Routledge, 2018) and *Cambridge
Companion to Film Music *(CUP, 2016). As an improviser, she regularly
performs solo, in various ad-hoc collaborations, and as one half of the
electroacoustic duo acte vide (with Yannis Kotsonis).  Her releases include
*[herewith]* for solo inside piano (Holotype, 2014), *Crease*, a duo with
guitarist Michalis Moschoutis (Coherent States, 2017), and a contribution
(as acte vide) to the *Anthology of Greek Experimental Electronic Music*
1966-2016  (*sub rosa*, 2019). Her visceral, intensely tactile approach to
the piano has been described as “real-time composition with no safety
net” ([mic.gr](http://mic.gr)) and compared to the sound of electronic and noise
musicians such as Russell Haswell, Kevin Drumm & Phill Niblock  (*The
Quietus*; *Just Outside*).
