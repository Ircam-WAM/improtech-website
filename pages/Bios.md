####Georges Bloch
composer and researcher, got an engineering degree before studying composition in U. C. San Diego (PH. D. in 1988). His compositions revolve around three centers of interest: music and space, interaction and collaboration with other artists. He is Associate professor at Strasbourg University and was instrumental in developing Tonmeister cursus in France, in Strasbourg and in Paris Conservatoire. Because of his interest for opera, he has been linked to music-theater productions as well as studies in film music. As researcher associated to Ircam in Paris, he actually works on the OMax/Somax/DYCI2 family of computer–assisted improvisation systems.

####Marc Chemillier 
was born in 1960 and began studying jazz piano in 1971 with Jack Diéval and Pierre Cornevin at the Schola Cantorum in Paris. Later he received a PhD in Computer Science and also has degrees in Mathematics, Musicology, Philosophy and Anthropology. He has been conducting fieldwork among the Nzakara of Central African Republic to study their harp music, and in Madagascar to work on the ethnomathematics of divination, and the trance music of the zither. Now Director of Studies at the EHESS in Paris (School for Advanced Studies in Social Sciences), his main interests focus on the design of a family of improvisation softwares in collaboration with IRCAM (OMax/ImproteK/Djazz), and their use in real live performances to study the impact of such devices in the social context of jazz concerts or traditional music rituals.

####Mari Kimura
is a violinist/composer and a leading figure in the field of interactive computer music. As a violinist, Mari is renowned for her mastery of subharmonics—the production of pitches that sound up to an octave below the violin’s lowest string—as well as for her dynamic performances as an improviser and her premieres of many notable compositions by today’s composers, including Luciano Berio and Salvadore Sciarrino, as well as a soloist with such major orchestras including the Tokyo Symphony and the Hamburg Symphony. She has received numerous awards and grants including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Fromm Commission Award, a residency at IRCAM, and at the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. She is active in the development of a prototype motion sensor “Mugic” for interactive computer music performance, and she is the founding chair of Future Music Lab at the Atlantic Music Festival.  Her latest solo album “Voyage Apollonian” (Innova Recordings) includes her recent works for violin and motion sensor “Mugic”.  A graduate faculty at Juilliard since 1998, this year, Mari was appointed as a Full Professor of Music at the “Integrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology” program (ICIT) at the University of California, Irvine.

####Jérôme Nika
is a postdoctoral researcher in the Music Representations team at Ircam (UMR STMS 9912 CNRS). He graduated from the “Grandes Écoles” Télécom ParisTech and ENSTA ParisTech. In addition, he studied acoustics, signal processing and computer science applied to music (multidisciplinary Master’s degree ATIAM in sciences and technologies for music, UPMC Paris 6, Télécom ParisTech, Ircam). His PhD work “Guiding human-computer music improvisation“ (“Young Researcher Prize in Science and Music" in 2015; “Young Researcher Prize" awarded by the French Association of Computer Music in 2016) focused on the introduction of authoring, composition, and control in human-computer music co-improvisation. Through the development of the software ImproteK and within the DYCI2 project, his research focuses on the integration of scenarios in music generation processes, and on the dialectic between reactivity and planning in interactive human-computer music improvisation.
