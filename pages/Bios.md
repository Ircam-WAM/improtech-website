<img src="../images/Blonk.jpg" width="320" style="float:left" hspace="10">
####Jaap Blonk
(born 1953 in Woerden, Holland) is a self-taught composer, performer and poet.
He went to university for mathematics and musicology but did not finish those studies. In the late 1970s he took up saxophone and started to compose music.
A few years later he discovered his potential as a vocal performer, at first in reciting poetry and later on in improvisations and his own compositions. For almost two decades the voice was his main means for the discovery and development of new sounds. From around the year 2000 on Blonk started work with electronics, at first using samples of his own voice, then extending the field to include pure sound synthesis as well.<br>
He took a year off of performing in 2006. As a result, his renewed interest in mathematics made him start a research of the possibilities of algorithmic composition for the creation of music, visual work and poetry.<br>
As a vocalist, Jaap Blonk is unique for his powerful stage presence and almost childlike freedom in improvisation, combined with a keen grasp of structure. He has performed around the world, on all continents. With the use of live electronics the scope and range of his concerts has acquired a considerable extension.<br>
Besides working as a soloist, he collaborated with many musicians and ensembles in the field of contemporary and improvised music, like Maja Ratkje, Mats Gustafsson, Joan La Barbara, The Ex, the Netherlands Wind Ensemble and the Ebony Band. He premiered several compositions by the German composer Carola Bauckholt, including a piece for voice and orchestra. A solo voice piece was commissioned by the Donaueschinger Musiktage. On several occasions he collaborated with visual computer artist Golan Levin, for the Ars Electronica Festival.<br>
Blonk's work for radio and television includes several commissioned radio plays.
He also makes larger-scale drawings of his scores, as well as visual poetry, which is being exhibited.<br>
He has his own record label, Kontrans, featuring a total of 25 releases so far. Other Blonk recordings appeared on various labels, such as Staalplaat, Basta, VICTO, Ecstatic Peace, Monotype Records, Terp and Elegua Records.<br>
His book/CD 'Traces of Speech' was published in 2012 by Hybriden-Verlag, Berlin. Forthcoming is a sequel with the title "Traces of Cookery".<br>
A comprehensive collection of his sound poetry came out as a book with 2 CDs in 2013, entitled "KLINKT".

####Clément Canonne
I am a CNRS researcher in the « Analysis of Musical Practices » team at IRCAM since 2015. My researches are mainly focused on collective free improvisation, bringing perspectives from ethnography and experimental psychology. Recent publications on this topic include papers in *Cognition, Music Theory Online, Empirical Musicology Review, Revue de Musicologie, Psychology of Music and Journal of New Music Research*.<br>
I am also interested in the philosophy of music – in collaboration Pierre Saint-Germier, I have translated in French two volumes of essays from the American philosopher Jerrold Levinson (Vrin, 2015 & 2019)– and in the empirical approaches of aesthetic issues.<br>
I am currently working on two large scale projects: the ANR-funded project « Musical Improvisation and Collective Action » (2018-2021), which aims to study joint action and emergent coordination through the lens of free improvisation; and an ethnographic inquiry into the material aspects of improvisers’ instrumental practices across many different genres (baroque, jazz, sound art, free improvisation and traditional music).

####Rémi Fox
Saxophonist, improviser and composer, Rémi Fox is part of this new generation of artist who wishes to make the jazz a resolutely contemporary music. He graduated from the Department Jazz and improvised music from the CNSMD of PARIS where he had the opportunity to build a strong musical experience, along with great musicians (being of his generation or more experienced one). All these encounters gave him the opportunity to take part in a great variety of projects, and develop a rich and open musical universe, while strengthening his own personality. During his studies, he entered the Department of Improvisation Generative of CNSMDP (directed by Vincent Lê Quang and Alexandros Markeas) to discover new ways of playing, and to begin with sound textures experimentation. During those years, he always seeked to confront his music to other forms of Art such as dance, video or Visual arts, leading to enriching collaborations with IRCAM, CNC (National Film and the moving image Centre) or Theatres. The “nOx project” (nOx.3, nOx.6, nOx.8), started in 2013, embodies Remi’s wish to now create its own path and musical personality. Through this innovative series, the young artist offers a smart mix between improvisation, contemporary electronic music, and genuine “nOxian” melodies.<br> [www.nox3.net](http://www.nox3.net)

####Hugues Genevois
is a researcher in musical acoustics, within the LAM team, at the Institut Jean le Rond d'Alembert (Sorbonne Université - CNRS).<br>
With a scientific background (Master of Science in Physics and Telecom ParisTech Engineering School), Hugues Genevois, became interested very early in musical composition and possibilities offered by computers for sound synthesis. However, if his tastes willingly lead him to concrete music and music from the Far East, it is through contact with Iannis Xenakis that he decides to deepen his writing work.<br>
After having produced numerous pieces of music on support, his interest in instrumental practice (electric guitar, cello, keyboards) led him to explore the expressive possibilities of the computer. His research focuses in particular on new lutheries and musician/instrument interaction.<br>
It was in 1997, during a symposium organized with the GMEM, in Marseilles, that he addressed what would later become the main theme of his research: the musical gesture. His approach is poetic as well as technical. It is in this context that he uses for the first time the term calliphony, a sonic and musical equivalent of *calligraphy*, in its Far Eastern sense.<br>
Also an improviser, he performs in various formations: *ONE* (electroacoustic septet), the *Méta-Orchestre*, the trios *Déjà-Là* (with Laurence Bouckaert and Michel Risse) and *Les complémentaires* (with György Kurtag jr. and Jean Haury), and in duet (*Moon Module* with Laurence Bouckaert, and *Ouï-Ouï* with Marie-Hélène Grimigni). He also founded the experimental rock group *Poppy NoGood*.

####Evan Parker
Evan Parker, saxophonist is one of the founding fathers of the European improvised music scene since the late 1960s. From Parliamentary Jazz Awards 2013 : Evan Parker...transformed the language and techniques of the instrument in the late 1960s and has since become one of the most admired and influential saxophone improvisers on the planet. Parker has been rewriting the book on the sounds that can be made with a saxophone for almost half a century, developing a remarkable post-Coltrane technique that has allowed him to play counterpoint on what was designed as a single-line instrument, generate electronics-like textures acoustically, and build a personal soundscape that avoids conventional tunes but has its own arresting lyricism. Parker has worked with comparable revolutionaries like John Zorn and Anthony Braxton, and played in experimental electro-acoustic groups and contemporary-classical ensembles - but he has also brought a sharp edge to more orthodox jazz lineups led by Stan Tracey, Kenny Wheeler and by the Rolling Stones Charlie Watts, and the celebrated South African orchestra Brotherhood of Breath. He has also recorded with singer-songwriter Robert Wyatt, with TV comic Vic Reeves, and has lent his inimitable sound to the more pop-oriented contexts of Scott Walker, David Sylvian and Jah Wobble.
Parker is widely acknowledged as "one of the music's greatest living instrumentalists" (The Times), "one of the world's finest ensemble improvisers" (Chicago Reader) and "one of the modern era's most original voices" (The Wire).

####Panagiotis E. Tsagkarakis
Born in Athens, 1975. He studied in the field Audio technology BSc in Salford University (UK) and specialized in real time audio processes and synthesis in interactive environments M.Eng Ionian University (GR). The last few years, his research was focused in immaterial interfaces for interactive performances in the ancient Greek drama, creating interactive prosodic tools and gestural sonification. This research was published both in scientific journals (International Journal of Music New Sound - 2019, International Journal of Music Science, Technology and Art – 2018) and conferences (International Conferences on New Music Concepts - 2018, Sonic and Music Computing Conference - 2018, Digital Culture and Audiovisual Challenges - 2018). In the last decade he designed many Interactive systems for new media theatrical and contemporary dance projects. He developed technologies applicable to each occasion in order to fulfill the given needs. This included the selection of sensor technologies and programming platform as well as programming the sound synthesis engine to produce inspiring and responsive sonic outcome. Part of everyday life was field recordings and audio processing to create the original sound design material.
