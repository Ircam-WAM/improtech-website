*HEXIS* (2019 World Premiere) 

Soloist, Bodycoder System and multi-channel diffusion.

*Hexis* is a Greek word that is important in the philosophy of Aristotle. It stems from a verb related to ‘possession’ and is typically translated in modern texts as referring to a ‘state’ of being. Sachs translates and refines the meaning as ‘active condition’ and argues that hexis refers to an active disposition that becomes a deeply embodied ‘state’ as opposed to a passive or surface action/interaction. For us hexis describes a way of being in performance. It is a deeply embodied active condition that operates at the core of an interactive phenomenology and fluid materiality that is central to our particular brand of improvisational kinaesonics. Our piece Hexis (2019) is thematically inspired by and draws upon Heraclitus’ older pre-Socratic river-analogy ‘one cannot step twice into the same river’ and for ‘as they step into the same rivers, different and (still) different waters flow upon them’. These ancient philosophical fragments (attributed to Heraclitus via Didymus & Plutarch) configure man’s state of being in relation to and as a part of a substance of nature. The river is an example of that which preserves structural identity while undergoing constant change of content, and it is this conflagration of unity/divergence, formation and dissolution, of the catching, touching and trickling away of substance that has informed the compositional architecture and underlying aesthetic principles of the piece. Hexis is the second work that seeks to explore the synergies between ancient motifs and our own distinct form of sonic mediation the first being PythiaDelphine:21 (2016) created with the kind support of Prof. Anastasia Georgaki and the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and premiered at Animart in Delphi.
